shadow_book.py -- S21b: evidence for a frozen sport, at zero risk.

A freeze stops orders, so it also stops the settlements that would justify
lifting it. NFL never hit this: 19 positions were already in flight when S1
landed, and they settle into the S1b review. **NCAAF has no such stream** --
it was frozen (S21, 2026-09-13) holding nothing, so its settled count is pinned
at 11 forever, under `nfl_week1_review.MIN_SETTLEMENTS` (20). A review armed on
the NFL pattern would return branch C on every run until the end of time: the
"fresh, green, and wrong" shape the 2026-09-10 entry is about.

This is the missing exit ramp. A Brier head-to-head needs only
(model probability, market price, outcome) -- **it never needed a filled
order**. So the model keeps scoring the sport, the rows are logged, Kalshi
settles them anyway, and the freeze stays fully in force.

Where it taps matters. `data/cache/last_scan.json` is written POST-risk-gate,
so at a frozen sport's 1.0 floor it holds nothing -- the freeze would suppress
exactly the rows under test. `scan_all_markets()` applies only the GLOBAL
`min_edge_threshold`, never the per-sport `min_edge_for()` (that is Gate 3, in
the executor), so collecting upstream of the gates records what the MODEL said
while the gates stay the thing being judged.

## Why this beats waiting for settled bets

It tests the actual hypothesis. S21's finding is that every NCAAF edge was one
uncalibrated parameter -- `margin_stdev` 15.0 against a market pricing ~9.5 --
and `_MIN_CALIB_SAMPLES` (20/sport/category/30d) means real bets could never
fit it. `review` re-projects each row's stored consensus at a range of stdevs
and reports which minimises MODEL Brier. That is a direct read on the parameter,
from rows that cost nothing, and it needs no filled order at all.

## Deliberately NOT a decision

Nothing here writes `.env` or lifts a freeze; contrast `nfl_week1_review.py`,
which does and is pre-declared. Shadow rows are not real fills: no slippage, no
queue position, and survivorship differs from a live book. This measures
CALIBRATION, which is the thing a freeze is waiting on -- it does not measure
tradeability. Read it, then decide by hand.

# ⏰ Edge-Radar Scheduled Tasks

**The repo owner's live Windows Task Scheduler setup: scan → execute → email → settle → reconcile → calibrate → review, unattended.**

> [!NOTE]
> **This is the schedule the repo owner actually runs, published as a reference, not a turnkey installer.** The owner's `.bat` files are gitignored (they hardcode a machine path and a private inbox), so this doc carries **sanitized templates** — see [Reproducing this on your own machine](#reproducing-this-on-your-own-machine). For just the minimal "execute + settle + calibration" core, start with [`AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md`](../setup/AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md) and its one-command installer.

**Task Scheduler folder:** `\AI-Projects\Edge-Radar-MikesAILab\` &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Times:** PT (ET in parentheses) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **History:** every add, change and retirement is in [`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

Task Scheduler is the only active scheduling mechanism. Every action launches through `scripts/schedulers/run-hidden.vbs` (no console flash; exit code passed through; a scheduler stop kills the whole process tree via `run-hidden-guard.ps1`). A separate `\AI-Projects\Edge-Radar-AltAgents\` folder holds 4 tasks for the Edge-Radar-Agy fork — a different repo, not covered here.

## At a Glance

⚠️ = **places real orders** (`DRY_RUN=false`). Every execute task emails its report as action 2 the moment the scan finishes.

| # | Task | Schedule (PT) | What it does |
|:-:|:-----|:--------------|:-------------|
| 1 | `Integration-Drift-Check` | Daily 4:15 AM | Probes Kalshi/odds integration for silent breakage (schema, rules wording, match rates); Claude analysis on WARN/FAIL or Mondays; on WARN/FAIL, may open a **draft PR** with a verified fix (never merges); emails the report |
| 2 | `Daily-Summary` | Daily 4:50 AM | Morning P&L digest (yesterday, open exposure, today pending, 7-day context), then emails it |
| 3 | `All-Sports-SameDay-Execution` ⚠️ | Daily 5:05 AM | Today's games, all sports — max 5 bets, 12% budget |
| 4 | `Shadow-Book-NCAAF` | Daily 6:00 AM | S21b shadow book: scores NCAAF + MLB spread markets pre-gate. **No orders** |
| 5 | `Weekly-Futures-Execution` ⚠️ | Sat 9:00 AM | Championship/outright futures — max 3 bets, 10% budget |
| 6 | `WeeklyAccountGraph` | Sun 9:40 AM | Refreshes the private account-growth graph (local only) |
| 7 | `All-Sports-NoDateFilter-Midday-Execution` ⚠️ | Daily 11:00 AM | Wide net, all dates — max 5 bets, 12% budget |
| 8 | `All-Sports-SameDay-Late-Execution` ⚠️ | Daily 2:00 PM | Tonight's games, late news — max 5 bets, 12% budget |
| 9 | `WeeklyOddsKeyProbe` | Sun 6:00 PM | Live-probes every Odds API key, refreshes the quota cache |
| 10 | `Calibration` | Sun 7:00 PM | Brier refresh + C8 stdev recalibration (`--days 30`) |
| 11 | `Backtest` | Sun 7:30 PM | Equity curve, drawdown, Sharpe, strategy comparison |
| 12 | `All-Sports-NextDay-Execution` ⚠️ | Sun–Thu 8:30 PM | Tomorrow's games — max 5 bets, 12% budget |
| 13 | `Reconcile` | Daily 11:30 PM | Local trade log vs Kalshi positions; flags drift |
| 14 | `Weekly-Analysis` | Sun 11:45 PM | 7-day performance report, then emails it |
| 15 | `Hourly-Settle` | Hourly at :35 | `kalshi_settler.py settle` — keeps Gate 1 (daily loss) current intraday |
| 16 | `CLV-Capture` | Every 5 min | S8: samples the closing book before each open position's event. Read-only at the venue |

### Fires per day (excluding Hourly-Settle and CLV-Capture)

| Day | Fires | Max new bets |
|:----|:-----:|:-------------|
| Mon–Thu | 8 | 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 (NextDay) = **20** |
| Fri | 7 | 5 + 5 + 5 = **15** (no NextDay) |
| Sat | 8 | 15 + 3 futures = **18** (no NextDay) |
| Sun | 13 | **20** |

The practical count is far lower: `--exclude-open`, Gate 7 series dedup, Gate 2b exposure caps and `--min-bets 1` all bind first. Gate 2 (`MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS`) is the hard ceiling.

### Halting live orders

```powershell
Disable-ScheduledTask -TaskPath '\AI-Projects\Edge-Radar-MikesAILab\' -TaskName '<task>'
```

Or set `DRY_RUN=true` in `.env` to stop every execute task at once (the CLI re-reads `.env` per run).

---

## Task Details

All `.bat` wrappers live under `scripts/schedulers/` (gitignored). Execute wrappers print `kalshi_executor.py status` before and after the scan.

### 1. `Integration-Drift-Check` — Daily 4:15 AM PT (7:15 AM ET)

| Property | Value |
|:--|:--|
| **Action 1** | `run-hidden.vbs` → `maintenance\drift_check.bat` → `scripts/kalshi/integration_drift.py --save --analyze auto --autofix` |
| **Action 2** | `render_report_email.py drift-check` → subject `Edge-Radar \| Integration Drift Check` |
| **Report** | `reports/Maintenance/drift/drift_<date>.md` |
| **Cost** | Probe is deterministic, no model, **zero Odds API quota** (reads cached odds only) |

**What the probe checks, per in-season sport series:** market schema fields present; team/strike parse rate from rules and subtitles; odds-event match rate against cached Odds API data; rules-wording templates not in the stored baseline; series prefixes returning zero markets; days since the last bet per sport.

**Claude analysis pass (read-only):** if the probe status is WARN/FAIL, **or** it is Monday, a headless `claude -p` session restricted to `Read,Grep,Glob,WebFetch,WebSearch` (no `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) diagnoses each flag, checks Kalshi's API changelog, and appends an **Analysis** section to the report.

**Auto-fix pass (WARN/FAIL days only, `scripts/kalshi/drift_autofix.py`):** a second Claude session gets edit access to a **throwaway git worktree** of `origin/mike_desktop`, never your checkout. Then deterministic checks decide whether a PR exists at all:

| Outcome of the fix session | Result |
|:--|:--|
| No files changed (false positive, or not confident) | **No PR.** Report says "No code change proposed" |
| Touched anything outside parsing/matching code + tests (`edge_detector.py`, `futures_edge.py`, `kalshi_client.py`, `ticker_display.py`, `odds_api.py`, `market_client.py`, `tests/`), or deleted a file | **Rejected, no PR.** Diff saved as `drift_<date>.rejected.patch` |
| Fewer tests collected, or the full suite fails (one retry with the failure output) | **Rejected, no PR** |
| Probe re-run on the fixed tree not better than today's | **Rejected, no PR** |
| All checks pass | Pushes `drift-fix/<date>`, opens a **draft** PR into `mike_desktop` with the before/after probe table and test output. Link is in the email |

It **never merges**, never touches master, `mike_desktop`, `.env`, the executor or the risk gates, and can't edit the probe that grades it. While a `drift-fix/*` PR is open, later runs skip the fix pass so one unresolved break doesn't open a PR every day. Tests and the probe run through `drift_autofix.py --in-tree`, because the venv's `edge_radar.pth` would otherwise import the main checkout's code instead of the fix.

**Why it exists:** M1 (CHANGELOG 2026-10-03). Kalshi reworded NFL rules to "... Pro Football game", team extraction failed silently, and the scanner was blind to 13 of 14 NFL games for ~2 weeks while every scan said "no opportunities". **Why 4:15 AM:** ahead of Daily-Summary (4:50) and the first execute (5:05), so a break is in the inbox before money moves.

### 2. `Daily-Summary` — Daily 4:50 AM PT (7:50 AM ET)

| Property | Value |
|:--|:--|
| **Action 1** | `maintenance\daily_summary.bat` → `daily_summary.py --save` |
| **Action 2** | `render_report_email.py daily-summary` → `Edge-Radar \| Daily Summary` |
| **Report** | `reports/Performance/daily_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (written even on empty days — proof of life) |

Runs after the overnight settle passes and before the 5:05 execute, so "Open Exposure" reflects overnight carry, not today's fills. Also reports post-kickoff orders (S23b). Three blank sections every morning for a week is a real signal: fills not captured, settler not finding settlements, or the pipeline paused.

### 3. `All-Sports-SameDay-Execution` ⚠️ — Daily 5:05 AM PT (8:05 AM ET)

| Property | Value |
|:--|:--|
| **Script** | `same_day_executions\same_day_execute.bat` |
| **Flags** | `--unit-size 1 --max-bets 5 --min-bets 1 --budget 12% --date today --exclude-open --save --execute` |
| **Report** | `reports/Sports/schedulers/same-day-executions/` |
| **Email** | `render_report_email.py same-day` → `Edge-Radar \| Same Day Execution Report` |

MLB starters announced, NHL morning skate done, weather stable, before sharp money fully lands.

### 4. `Shadow-Book-NCAAF` — Daily 6:00 AM PT

Runs `maintenance\shadow_book.bat`: `shadow_book.py settle`, then `collect --filter ncaafb` and `collect --filter KXMLBSPREAD` (log `logs/shadow_book.log`). **Places no orders.** A freeze stops orders and so stops the settlements that would justify lifting it; a Brier head-to-head needs only model probability, market price and outcome. Taps `scan_all_markets()` **upstream of the risk gates** (`last_scan.json` is post-gate and holds nothing at a 1.0 floor). Read it with `shadow_book.py review --sport ncaaf --save`. Despite the name it also tracks MLB spreads (frozen 2026-10-03).

### 5. `Weekly-Futures-Execution` ⚠️ — Sat 9:00 AM PT (12:00 PM ET)

| Property | Value |
|:--|:--|
| **Script** | `futures_executions\weekly_futures_execute.bat` |
| **Flags** | `scan.py futures --unit-size 1 --max-bets 3 --min-bets 1 --budget 10% --exclude-open --save --report-dir "reports\Futures\schedulers" --execute` |
| **Email** | `render_report_email.py weekly-futures` → `Edge-Radar \| Weekly Futures Execution Report` |

Thin, longshot-heavy boards — most weeks place **0 bets**, by design. `futures_edge.py` always writes a report on `--save`, so empty weeks still email. Offseason series with no outright odds are skipped; golf prices only the 4 majors.

### 6. `WeeklyAccountGraph` — Sun 9:40 AM PT

Direct `python.exe scripts\schedulers\automation\refresh_account_graph.py`. Pulls the live Kalshi snapshot and regenerates the interactive HTML + PNG into `docs/my-documents/account-graph/latest/` (gitignored), log `logs/account_graph_refresh.log`. **Never published** — it carries real balance figures and the repo is public (CHANGELOG 2026-09-07). Install: `install_windows_task.py install account-graph`.

### 7. `All-Sports-NoDateFilter-Midday-Execution` ⚠️ — Daily 11:00 AM PT (2:00 PM ET)

| Property | Value |
|:--|:--|
| **Script** | `no_date_filter_executions\no_date_filter_execution_midday.bat` |
| **Flags** | `--unit-size 1 --max-bets 5 --min-bets 1 --budget 12% --exclude-open --save --execute` (**no `--date`**) |
| **Email** | `render_report_email.py nodatefilter-midday` → `Edge-Radar \| NoDateFilter Midday Execution Report` |

The no-date-filter scan finds candidates nearly every run while `--date today` is empty most mornings; slate width was the bottleneck, not time of day (`timing-analysis-2026-05-17.md`). 11 AM also catches MLB pitcher confirmations and NBA/NHL morning-skate news. Gate 3.7 (14-day cap) bounds how far out it can buy game markets.

### 8. `All-Sports-SameDay-Late-Execution` ⚠️ — Daily 2:00 PM PT (5:00 PM ET)

| Property | Value |
|:--|:--|
| **Script** | `same_day_executions\same_day_execute_late.bat` |
| **Flags** | `--unit-size 1 --max-bets 5 --min-bets 1 --budget 12% --date today --exclude-open --save --execute` |
| **Email** | `render_report_email.py same-day-late` → `Edge-Radar \| Same-Day Late Execution Report` |

Late-breaking news on tonight's slate: scratches, goalie confirmations, afternoon sharp moves.

### 9. `WeeklyOddsKeyProbe` — Sun 6:00 PM PT

`maintenance\odds_keys.bat` → `check_odds_keys.py --live` (~14 requests/week). Refreshes `data/cache/odds_api_quota.json` so a key going bad is caught before a scan needs it. Pairs with the `_ZERO_TTL_HOURS` expiry in `scripts/shared/odds_api.py` (CHANGELOG 2026-09-09).

### 10. `Calibration` — Sun 7:00 PM PT

`maintenance\calibration.bat` → `model_calibration.py --days 30 --save`. Brier score, calibration curves, per-sport/confidence/edge breakdowns, and the **C8 stdev recalibration** into `data/cache/calibration_stdevs.json`. The window must stay at 30: at `--days 7` no (sport, category) pair reached `_MIN_CALIB_SAMPLES=20` and the loop silently wrote the defaults back (CHANGELOG 2026-07-31; `tests/test_calibration_config.py` guards it).

### 11. `Backtest` — Sun 7:30 PM PT

`maintenance\backtest.bat` → `backtester.py --simulate --save`. Equity curve, drawdown, streaks, profit factor, Sharpe, ROI, breakdowns and filter-strategy simulation. Runs after Calibration.

### 12. `All-Sports-NextDay-Execution` ⚠️ — Sun–Thu 8:30 PM PT (11:30 PM ET)

| Property | Value |
|:--|:--|
| **Script** | `next_day_executions\next_day_execute.bat` |
| **Flags** | `--unit-size 1 --max-bets 5 --min-bets 1 --budget 12% --date tomorrow --exclude-open --save --execute` |
| **Email** | `render_report_email.py next-day` → `Edge-Radar \| Next Day Edge Report` |

8:30 PM PT gives books time to post next-day lines (it was empty 43% of the time at 6 PM). Fri/Sat are skipped; the Sunday 5:05 AM run covers Sunday NFL with fresher data. To run it ad hoc on a skipped night: `Start-ScheduledTask -TaskPath '\AI-Projects\Edge-Radar-MikesAILab\' -TaskName 'All-Sports-NextDay-Execution'`.

### 13. `Reconcile` — Daily 11:30 PM PT

`maintenance\reconcile.bat` → `kalshi_settler.py reconcile`. Runs 55 minutes after the 10:35 PM settle pass, so drift it reports is real: a missed settlement, API lag, or local-log corruption.

### 14. `Weekly-Analysis` — Sun 11:45 PM PT

| Property | Value |
|:--|:--|
| **Action 1** | `maintenance\weekly_analysis.bat` → `betting_analysis.py --days 7 --save` |
| **Action 2** | `render_report_email.py weekly-analysis` → `Edge-Radar \| Weekly Performance Analysis` |
| **Report** | `reports/Performance/betting_analysis_YYYY-MM-DD_7d.md` |

Runs after Reconcile and the 11:35 settle. The filename carries the UTC date (tomorrow's), which is why the emailer picks the newest fresh file rather than today's name.

### 15. `Hourly-Settle` — every hour at :35

Direct `python.exe scripts\kalshi\kalshi_settler.py settle`. Keeps the trade log fresh so Gate 1 sees intraday settlements and R4 / S23c resting-order cleanup runs on time. Safe alongside execute tasks thanks to the M2 cross-process trade-log lock. **:35** is the one minute slot clear of every other task. Install: `install_windows_task.py install settle`.

### 16. `CLV-Capture` — every 5 minutes

`maintenance\clv_capture.bat` → `clv_capture.py` (log `logs/clv_capture.log`). Samples the book shortly before each open position's event and writes the closing book + CLV to the trade row. Calls `get_market()` only — never places, cancels or modifies. A pass with nothing due makes **zero** API calls, which is what makes the cadence affordable. Venue reads happen outside the M2 lock; captures are re-applied by `trade_id` inside it.

## Reproducing this on your own machine

You need two kinds of files — `.bat` wrappers and `schtasks` registrations. You do **not** need all 16 tasks: the **minimal core is `All-Sports-SameDay-Execution` + `Hourly-Settle`**, then add `Calibration`, then emails and the extra execute runs as you trust the pipeline. Run the [dry-run workflow](#dry-run-testing-workflow) before any execute task can spend real money.

### Placeholders

| Placeholder | Meaning | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `<REPO_ROOT>` | Absolute path to your Edge-Radar checkout | `C:\Users\you\Edge-Radar` |
| `<YOUR_EMAIL>` | Inbox reports go **to** (`.env` → `NOTIFY_EMAIL`) | `you@example.com` |
| `<YOUR_SENDER>` | Verified-domain address reports come **from** (`.env` → `RESEND_FROM`) | `Edge-Radar <fleet@send.yourdomain.com>` |
| `<FOLDER>` | Your Task Scheduler folder | `\Edge-Radar\` |

`RESEND_API_KEY` lives in the **OS environment**, not `.env` (`setx RESEND_API_KEY "re_..."`), so Task Scheduler picks up a rotated key on the next launch. A User-scoped variable is invisible to `SYSTEM`, which is why these tasks run as your own user.

> **Time zone:** Task Scheduler fires on your machine's local time. Pick times that suit your slate, not these literal values.

### Template A — execute wrapper (`.bat`)

```batch
@echo off
REM WARNING: places live orders when DRY_RUN=false in .env.
REM Self-locate the repo root (adjust ..\..\.. to your folder depth):
cd /d "%~dp0..\..\.."

.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\kalshi\kalshi_executor.py status
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\scan.py sports ^
  --unit-size 1 --max-bets 5 --min-bets 1 --budget 12%% ^
  --date today --exclude-open --save ^
  --report-dir "reports\Sports\schedulers\same-day-executions" --execute
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\kalshi\kalshi_executor.py status
```

`%%` is required: a literal `%` must be doubled inside a `.bat`. The owner's variants differ only in `--date` and `--report-dir`:

| Variant | `--date` | `--report-dir` |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Same-day | `today` | `same-day-executions` |
| Midday wide net | *(omit)* | `no-date-filter-midday-executions` |
| Late same-day | `today` | `same-day-late-executions` |
| Next-day | `tomorrow` | `next-day-executions` |

> Scheduler `.bat` files pass `--unit-size` and `--budget` explicitly, so `.env` changes to those knobs never reach automated runs. Change both.

### Template B — maintenance wrapper (`.bat`)

```batch
@echo off
cd /d "%~dp0..\..\.."
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\kalshi\kalshi_settler.py settle
```

| Task | Last line |
|:--|:--|
| Settle / Reconcile | `scripts\kalshi\kalshi_settler.py settle` / `reconcile` |
| Calibration | `scripts\kalshi\model_calibration.py --days 30 --save` |
| Backtest | `scripts\backtest\backtester.py --simulate --save` |
| Weekly-Analysis | `scripts\kalshi\betting_analysis.py --days 7 --save` |
| Daily-Summary | `scripts\kalshi\daily_summary.py --save` |
| Odds key probe | `scripts\shared\check_odds_keys.py --live` |
| CLV capture | `scripts\kalshi\clv_capture.py >> logs\clv_capture.log 2>&1` |

### Template C — report emailer (tracked, nothing to copy)

`scripts/schedulers/automation/render_report_email.py <preset>` renders the report markdown to inline-styled HTML (markdown-it-py, tables byte-exact) and sends through `scripts/custom/Python/send_report_email.py` (Resend). **No model involved.**

| Preset | Task | Subject | Log |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `drift-check` | `Integration-Drift-Check` | `Edge-Radar \| Integration Drift Check` | `logs/email_drift_check.log` |
| `daily-summary` | `Daily-Summary` | `Edge-Radar \| Daily Summary` | `logs/email_daily_summary.log` |
| `same-day` | `All-Sports-SameDay-Execution` | `Edge-Radar \| Same Day Execution Report` | `logs/email_sameday.log` |
| `nodatefilter-midday` | `All-Sports-NoDateFilter-Midday-Execution` | `Edge-Radar \| NoDateFilter Midday Execution Report` | `logs/email_nodatefilter_midday.log` |
| `same-day-late` | `All-Sports-SameDay-Late-Execution` | `Edge-Radar \| Same-Day Late Execution Report` | `logs/email_sameday_late.log` |
| `next-day` | `All-Sports-NextDay-Execution` | `Edge-Radar \| Next Day Edge Report` | `logs/email_nextday.log` |
| `weekly-futures` | `Weekly-Futures-Execution` | `Edge-Radar \| Weekly Futures Execution Report` | `logs/email_futures.log` |
| `weekly-analysis` | `Weekly-Analysis` | `Edge-Radar \| Weekly Performance Analysis` | `logs/email_weekly_analysis.log` |

- **Which report:** the newest file in the preset's folder modified within `--max-age-hours` (default 3) — not today's name, because filenames carry the UTC date.
- **No fresh report:** exits 2 and sends nothing. A stale email is worse than none.
- **Preview:** `render_report_email.py same-day --dry-run out.html`. **Probe Resend without spending quota:** `send_report_email.py --check`.
- Every successful send stamps `logs/last_email_sent.json`, so a broken mail path is detectable on its own.

### Registering the tasks

**Action 1 (the `.bat`, launched hidden):**

```powershell
schtasks /Create /TN "<FOLDER>All-Sports-SameDay-Execution" `
  /TR "wscript.exe \"<REPO_ROOT>\scripts\schedulers\run-hidden.vbs\" \"<REPO_ROOT>\scripts\schedulers\same_day_executions\same_day_execute.bat\"" `
  /SC DAILY /ST 05:05 /F
```

**Action 2 (the email).** `schtasks` can only create one action; append the second with PowerShell. Task Scheduler runs action 2 even if action 1 exits non-zero:

```powershell
$t     = Get-ScheduledTask -TaskPath "<FOLDER>" -TaskName "All-Sports-SameDay-Execution"
$email = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "wscript.exe" `
  -Argument '"<REPO_ROOT>\scripts\schedulers\run-hidden.vbs" "<REPO_ROOT>\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" "<REPO_ROOT>\scripts\schedulers\automation\render_report_email.py" same-day'
Set-ScheduledTask -TaskPath "<FOLDER>" -TaskName "All-Sports-SameDay-Execution" -Action $t.Actions[0],$email
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`schtasks /Create` cannot set `StartWhenAvailable`, and every task needs it.** Without it, a trigger that passes while the machine is off or asleep is **dropped silently** — the task still reads `Ready`, and `LastTaskResult 267011` ("not yet run") looks identical to a task waiting for a future date. Two one-shot reviews were lost this way for ~4 months. Set it after every create (`install_windows_task.py` does this itself):
>
> ```powershell
> $t = Get-ScheduledTask -TaskPath "<FOLDER>" -TaskName "All-Sports-SameDay-Execution"
> $t.Settings.StartWhenAvailable = $true
> Set-ScheduledTask -TaskPath "<FOLDER>" -TaskName "All-Sports-SameDay-Execution" -Settings $t.Settings
> ```
>
> **On execute tasks this changes behaviour:** a missed run fires on wake, against whatever slate is live then. Bounded by Gate 4.8, Gate 3.7 and the task's own `--budget` / `--max-bets`.

| Cadence | `schtasks` flags |
|:--|:--|
| Every day | `/SC DAILY /ST HH:MM` |
| Sun–Thu | `/SC WEEKLY /D SUN,MON,TUE,WED,THU /ST HH:MM` |
| One weekday | `/SC WEEKLY /D SUN /ST HH:MM` |
| Hourly at :35 | `/SC HOURLY /MO 1 /ST 00:35` |
| Every 5 min | `/SC MINUTE /MO 5` |

From Git Bash, prefix `schtasks` with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` or the `/TN` path is mangled into a filesystem path:

```bash
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 schtasks /run /tn "\AI-Projects\Edge-Radar-MikesAILab\Daily-Summary"
```

| `LastTaskResult` non-zero on a two-action task | Either action. Read the scan's report/log **and** the `logs/email_*.log` line before deciding which failed |
| Email action exit **2** | No report modified within 3h — the scan failed before saving, or wrote elsewhere. Nothing sent, by design |
| Send error in the email log | Unverified domain or revoked `RESEND_API_KEY`. `send_report_email.py --check` |
| `267009` (0x41301) | Still running |
| `267011` (0x41303) | Never run — or a missed trigger without `StartWhenAvailable` (see above) |
| Scan says "no opportunities" for days | Could be a quiet slate **or a silent matching failure** (M1). Check the latest `Integration-Drift-Check` report for parse/match rates |
| Unknown `--filter` name | Falls through to a literal prefix that matches nothing, and prints a NOTE. Fix filters in code, not the `.bat` |

**`DaysOfWeek` bitmask** (from `Get-ScheduledTask` triggers): Sun 1, Mon 2, Tue 4, Wed 8, Thu 16, Fri 32, Sat 64. So `31` = Sun–Thu, `64` = Sat.

**Folder targeting:** `schtasks /create /tn "MyTask"` lands in the root `\`; always pass the full folder path.

## Dry-Run Testing Workflow

1. Set `DRY_RUN=true` in `.env`.
2. Run, safest first: `Reconcile` → `Calibration` → `Backtest` → `Hourly-Settle` → `Integration-Drift-Check` → `All-Sports-NextDay-Execution` → `All-Sports-NoDateFilter-Midday-Execution` → `render_report_email.py <preset> --dry-run out.html`.
3. Check: report file exists, no positions opened, exit code 0, email renders and matches the file, settle/reconcile report no drift.
4. Set `DRY_RUN=false` when confident.

## Retired Tasks

None of these are registered any more. Reasons and evidence are in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) under the date given.

| Task | Retired | Why |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `Email-*` (9 tasks: SameDay, NextDay, Midday, Late, Daily-Summary, Weekly-Analysis, Weekly-Futures, Polymarket, Longshot) | 2026-09-23 | Folded into their scan tasks as action 2; `claude -p` emailers replaced by `render_report_email.py` |
| `NightlySettle` | 2026-09-23 | Duplicate of `Hourly-Settle` |
| `Daily-Polymarket-Execution` (ex `Daily-Polymarket-DryRun`) | 2026-09-29 | Polymarket venue removed |
| `Longshot-Scan` | 2026-09-27 | Longshot strategy abandoned (P1 profile mechanism kept) |
| `NFL-Week1-Review` | after 2026-09-15 | One-shot S1b review; fired 09-15, returned branch A (removal date not recorded) |
| `MonthlyCalibration` | 2026-07-31 | Duplicate of weekly `Calibration`; had never once run |
| `R8-Review`, `U2-Review` | 2026-09-10 | One-shots that never fired (no `StartWhenAvailable`); R8 run by hand, both deleted. XML in `scripts/schedulers/retired-task-xml/` |
| `All-Sports-NoDateFilter-Execution` (Mon/Thu 5:20 AM) | 2026-05-17 | Replaced by the daily Midday run |
| `*-Scan` preview tasks (SameDay, NoDateFilter, MLB/NBA/NHL/NFL-NextDay) | — | Preview-only or per-sport variants, superseded by the consolidated execute tasks; their `.bat` files remain as reference |

# Upstreams

Every external service and library Edge-Radar depends on, what the code assumes about each,
and where to check whether that assumption still holds. The biweekly **Edge-Radar Upstream
Check** routine (`upstream/auto-*` PRs) works from this file. Keep it current by hand too:
a new API client is a new row.

**Money path** rows touch order placement, fills, settlement, or cash. The routine never
changes code on them. It opens a ROADMAP item and flags it in its PR body.

**Last checked** is filled in by the routine, and only with a date it actually read the
source. `—` means never checked.

## Execution venues (money path)

| Upstream | What the code assumes | Code | Check at | Last checked |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Kalshi Trade API v2** | Base `api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`; RSA-PSS request signing; fills and positions arrive as fixed-point strings (`fill_count_fp`, `position_fp`) and can be fractional (ROADMAP S28); the exchange is sharded (shard 2 Crypto & Commodities, shard 3 Tennis, Baseball & Basketball; names read live from `/exchange/status`, the shard of each market from its `exchange_index`) and cash does not follow the markets; the money path reads `*_dollars` price fields and sends whole-cent limits, which lie on every published `price_ranges` grid; the series tickers in the sport filters exist (`KXNCAAFGAME`, not `KXNCAAFBGAME`); the fee schedule | `scripts/kalshi/kalshi_client.py`, `kalshi_executor.py`, `kalshi_settler.py`, `app/config.py` · reference: `docs/kalshi/kalshi-sports-betting/KALSHI_API_REFERENCE.md` | docs.kalshi.com (API reference and changelog); kalshi.com/docs/kalshi-fee-schedule.pdf | 2026-10-05 |

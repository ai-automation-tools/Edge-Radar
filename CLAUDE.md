# CLAUDE.md — Edge-Radar (Claude Code-only notes)

The rules, gates and limits all live in `AGENTS.md` (imported above). This file holds only what is
specific to Claude Code.

- On startup, load the memory index at `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` and read the entries relevant to the task.
- **Skills:** `/edge-radar` and `/edge-radar-analysis` are tracked in `skills/` at the repo root; `.claude/skills/` holds Windows junctions to them (git-ignored — real symlinks can't be committed with `core.symlinks=false`). **Edit `skills/`, never the junctions.** After a fresh clone: `pwsh -File scripts/setup/link_skills.ps1`.
- Project slash commands live in `.claude/commands/`; agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`.
